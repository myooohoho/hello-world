Always urging to learn sth
I'm a Korean.
I'm an elementary teacher.
I had been the main teacher of the 6th, 4th, 2nd, 3rd grade students.
I really feel very accomplishment on my work.
Actually I had majored in Languastics(Korean education), but I'm pretty interested in Artificial Intelligence.
So thesedays' my main profiles are two - one as a teacher and the other as a student studying and reseaching for AI.
I hope being able to teach AI(how to code, what is AI, why we code, why we need AI etc.) in the future.
